# Code Fence Examples

A simple backtick fence with language tag:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
int main() {
    std::cout << "hello\n";
    return 0;
}
```

A backtick fence opened with 4 ticks (closing with same length):

````python
def greet():
    print("hi")
````

A tilde fence example:

~~~js
console.log('tilde fence');
~~~

A backtick opener with 3 ticks and a longer closing run (4 ticks) is also valid in our samples:

```text
This fence opens with 3 backticks...
````
